## [Javascript: The Hard Parts, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts-v2/)

### Topics
- Good breakdown of execution contexts and a very thorough exploration of closure. 
- Async as it relates to "facade functions", and how these non javascript API calls can easily trick you. Covering event loop, callback queue and microtask queue.
- Promises, and how they're awesome.
- Classes & Prototypes. this, arrow function scope as it relates to this, and how classes in Javascript are just syntactial sugar.
### Notes
Great course, concise and effective discussion. Learnt the most from the prototype overloading and how classes are just a nicer way of achieving this. Remember historical issues with combinations of async and setTimeout that made no sense to me then, but do now, with understanding of the difference between callback and microtask queue.
